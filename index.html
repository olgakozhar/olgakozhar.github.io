                <p><strong>The greatest gift is your presence. Period.</strong></p>
                <p>Beyond that, if you would like to give a gift, links to registries are provided below. If you're someone with second hand baby items you'd like to give like clothes, books, or toys, those make great gifts as well! This is a reduce/reuse/recycle friendly baby shower.  </p>

                <p>Please feel free to utilize the registry of the mom(s)-to-be with whom you are close to. There is no expectation that if a gift is bought for one mom that a gift must be bought for the other.</p>
                <p>Additionally, for those who so desire to bring gifts, <strong><em>DIAPERS</em></strong> make a wonderful gift. For those electing to give diapers, it is recommended to get a larger (older) size because newborn diapers will only be suitable for a very brief window.</p>
                <p>Still wanting to give but not sure what? In this economy? Consider giving the gift of cash. </p>
